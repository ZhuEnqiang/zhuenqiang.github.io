I received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2015. Iâ€™m a Professor at the Institute of Computing Science and Technology, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China. My current research interests include theoretical, algorithmic, and applied research on hard problems.
